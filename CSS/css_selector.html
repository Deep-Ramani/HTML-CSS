    <!-- CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
    
    we can divide the selector in the five category


    Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


    Selector    	    Example 	    Example description
    #id 	            #firstname 	    Selects the element with id="firstname"
    .class 	            .intro 	        Selects all elements with class="intro"
    element.class 	    p.intro 	    Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
    * 	                * 	            Selects all elements
    element 	        p 	            Selects all <p> elements
    element,element,.. 	div, p 	        Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements
